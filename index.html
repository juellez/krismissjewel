				<p>We've moved! New address below.
<br><br>
					This year we found ourselves amidst LOTS of change, transition, goodbyes, and new beginnings. Jewel completed two year-long trainings for her new path in somatic coaching and healing, Kris shut down his recording studio of 15 years (The Map Room), and together we put Kris' home on the market and Jewel's up for rent&mdash;and bought a new home (The Garden Palace) a few quiet minutes outside of a quirky and beautiful mountain town in the Ozarks&mdash;Eureka Springs. 
<br><br>

					We are grateful to have spent much of the year with so much extended family and friends, including a trip to Estes Park and Rocky National Park for Kris' parent's 50<sup>th</sup> wedding anniversary and a trip to Iowa for a Mlnarik family reunion to celebrate a 50<sup>th</sup> birthday (where we also got to drop in on some old friends in Des Moines). Jewel also enjoyed a train trip with her dad and aunt Diane to Massachusettes for Sarah & Jon's wedding, visited London and a wee bit of Ireland for the first time to visit her friend Liza, enjoyed several visits to Oreville CA alongside her trainings in Petaluma to visit her mom & brother James, and got to visit her cousins Tricia & Joe in Santa Clara and their incredibly creative girls who graciously shared their room. 
<br><br>
					We hosted Jewel's sister Jenni and fam in the summer, right before hosting Jewel's brother Jake and fiance Ivory and Kris's brother Hunter for Pickathon. Additional musical highlights include seeing the Wooten brothers in Seattle and getting to spend Easter with Jewel's uncle Rick and cousins Tom & Nick&mdash;and two Folk & Forage festivals, along with several Portland shows.
<br><br>
<!-- 
					It was at Kris's family trip in June that we decided to trade the NW Pacific for NW Arkansas and announce our plans to move. Naturally, it meant we should visit and make sure this spot on a map would work for us. So we flew out for Labor Day weekend to scout and one syncronicity led to another and before we could believe it, we put an offer in on a house and got it. We got Kris's house ready for market in September; Jewel flew out in October to get the new keys and mow the yard; movers hauled our furniture and Kris drove across the country to start getting us settled in in Nov; and then Jewel got her house ready for renters and hit the road in December.
<br><br> -->

					Countless friends and family pitched in to help us&mdash;and words can barely do justice to express our gratitude. As we continue to get settled and find our stationary, we look forward to writing and hosting and making more music together.
<br><br>

					Until then, please know that you're in our hearts. And may you enjoy a little Christmas ditty from last year ;-)

				<h2>ps.</h2>
				<p>Life is hard, you are loved, life is beautiful, and we all deserve to live in <em>Beloved Community</em>. 
				May winter (for those of you in the Northern Hemisphere) bring deserved rest, reflection, hibernation, and tranquility to appreciate the sounds within silence, the warmth within a huddle and your own hands, 
				and what we need (and don't) to feel deserving of Love, of which we can't overdose. <nobr><sub>&#10084;</sub>&#10084;<sup>&#10084;</sup></nobr></p>

				<h2>ps. Itching for some non-holiday music?</h2>
				<p>While Kris is a professional musician and sound engineer, he lovingingly agreed to make 
					some silly holiday songs with his girlfriend (and we somehow survived!) that we recorded at home. 
					You can find him in the wild as <a href="https://soundcloud.com/juanprophet">Juan Prophet Organization</a>. And you can find Jewel's debut album as <a href="https://kimnema.com/">KÍmNEMÁ</a>.
